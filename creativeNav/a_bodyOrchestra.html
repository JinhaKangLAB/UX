  <!--Brian Tracy-->
                    <li>After more than two years of a pandemic, people are losing a sense of intimate relationships. <br>The sense of touch is blurred, and proximity is fading. <br>Social distancing forces people apart and makes people hesitate to get close to one other. <br>Therefore, I wanted to build something that evokes the feeling we are slowly forgetting. <br>I built a wearable gadget called ‘Body Orchestra,’ <br>which helps two people to interact with each other physically <br>and helps them to experience the journey of building intimacy and fully being in the moment.</li>

                    <li><p><i><br>"I was nervous whenever I encountered a new person to play the Body Orchestra. <br>However, as soon as the
                        audience and I got closure and found our own pace, <br>we finally relaxed and started enjoying playing and
                        harmonizing the music.<br>
                        At the end of the play, we could feel a special bond and intimacy.<br>
                        Every person I performed with was unique,<br> and the harmonies we created are amazingly colorful."</i><br><br><br></p>
