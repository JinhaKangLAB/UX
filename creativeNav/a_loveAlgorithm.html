                    <li></li>
                    <li>Describing 'Love' is a challenging task as people possess their unique interpretation systems and understanding of it, shaped by their desires and needs. <br>Often, we find ourselves in situations where we feel we are not receiving what we have given. <br>This led me to think love functions similarly to embedded algorithms of robots. <br>In pursuit of exploring this concept, I created a pillow-like robot that operates on an unknown algorithm, <br>and attempted to express its emotions through actions like petting, hugging, and rotating.<br> The robot provided feedback through changes in its colors, vibrations, and music,<br>however, I could never comprehend the essence of its emotions fully.<br> I acknowledged that the process of love is intricate and unpredictable. <br>Yet, I remain committed to continuing to love and never giving up, as humans always do.<br>
