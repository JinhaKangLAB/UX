                Abstract<br><p>This prototype validates new design paradigms in furniture design and ubiquitous computing that offers novel affordances for extended reality telepresence. The table interface features two screens, situated back to back, with two mounted cameras, facing in opposite directions. This creates the effect of looking through a window, upon which virtual content can be overlaid. This configuration allows local users sitting around the table to more easily interact with remote users, who appear on both sides of the Mixed Reality Passthrough Window, giving the sense that all users are sharing the same space.  The effect is further enhanced by the relative proportions and orientation embodied in the form language of the table, as well as the careful attention given to the UX/UI. </p></div> -->
