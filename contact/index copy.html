                    <p>Jnha Kang is a multidisciplinary artist who usually uses a mixture of performance and technological tools. She explores how human cognition, emotions, and relationships change when people or groups incorporate new technology into their lives.She brings these phenomena into her artistic experiments to find out the results based on her performance using technology and responses from the audience and society at large. >Her most representative and recent works are "Love Algorithm," "Emotional Marketing," "Audio Guide," and "Body Orchestra." Her artworks have resonated with audience members who sympathize with her idea that people have emotional leveling algorithms and have been rapidly swept into consumption due to technology. She also has talked about how people have adapted to a new system that the latest technology has generated, the relational bond between people and technology, and patterns of human behavior.</p>
