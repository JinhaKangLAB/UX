            <h3><br>Jinha Kang is a multidisciplinary artist who usually uses a mixture of
                performance and technological tools. She explores how human cognition,
                emotions, and relationships change when people or groups incorporate
                new technology into their lives.She brings these phenomena into her
                artistic experiments to find out the results based on her performance using
                technology and responses from the audience and society at large. >Her
                    most representative and recent works are "Love Algorithm," "Emotional
                    Marketing," "Audio Guide," and "Body Orchestra." Her artworks have
                    resonated with audience members who sympathize with her idea that
                    people have emotional leveling algorithms and have been rapidly swept
                    into consumption due to technology. She also has talked about how people
                    have adapted to a new system that the latest technology has generated,
                    the relational bond between people and technology, and patterns of
                    human behavior. <br></p>
                <p>She was born and raised in an IT power nation, Korea, and
                    earned her BFA in sculpture from Seoul National University, graduating as
                    valedictorian. She has exhibited group shows in Seoul, Korea, and received
                    the Excellent Prize from Seoul National University and Moon Gum Rye
                    Scholarship. Currently, Jinha Kang is getting her MFA in Digital + Media
                    from the RISD, Providence, RI, USA. </p>
